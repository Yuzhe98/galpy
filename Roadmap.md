Longer term goals for galpy

* Implement (J,angle) -> (x,v) transformations; implement the torus machinery. This to help in creating action-angle distributions taking selection effects into account.

* More support for dealing with simulations: potentials derived from simulations for static orbit integrations, action-angle calculations for simulations, some well-defined interface to read simulations into the galpy framework (see Rok's work, pynbody).

* Support to sample from DFs and at least write command files that allow these to be evolved with gadget, NEMO, or similar.

* Spheroid DFs: e.g., Binney and Posti's work on extending ergodic, Eddington DFs to flattened DFs.

* Support for simple N-body simulations within galpy (e.g., [small-N]-body interactions).

Please let me know if you are interested in helping out with any of these!
